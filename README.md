In this app you can populate still gifs with clicking a button of comedians already selected, or adding new comedians in the text box, which will give them their own button to click. Once the still gifs populate, you can click the gifs to animate an individual one and click to also stop said gif. The link to the browser website for this app is: https://willh1980.github.io/GiphyAPIs/.
